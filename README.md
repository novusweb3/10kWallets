## Ethereum Wallet Manager

A robust Node.js application for creating, funding, and managing multiple Ethereum wallets in batches. This tool allows for efficient creation of multiple wallets, funding them from a main wallet, and returning specified portions of the funds.


## Features

‚ú® Batch wallet creation and management

üí∞ Automated funding of new wallets

‚Ü©Ô∏è Automatic fund return functionality

‚ö° Efficient batch processing

üîç Transaction confirmation monitoring

üõ°Ô∏è Built-in error handling and recovery

üìä Detailed operation reporting


## Prerequisites

Node.js (v12.0.0 or higher)

npm or yarn

An Ethereum node URL (Infura, local node, etc.)

A funded Ethereum wallet to use as the main wallet

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or create a new directory:

```bash
  mkdir ethereum-wallet-manager
  cd ethereum-wallet-manager
```
    
2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
  npm init -y
```

3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install web3
```

4. Create the main script file:

```bash
touch wallet-manager.js
```

5. Copy the provided code into wallet-manager.js
## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure the following:

1. Update the RPC URL in the Web3 initialization:
```bash
javascriptCopyconst web3 = new Web3("Your_RPC_URL");
```

2. Set your main wallet's private key:
```bash
javascriptCopyconst manager = new WalletManager("Your_Main_Private_Key", 50);
```

3. Adjust batch size if needed (default is 50):
```bash
javascriptCopyconst batchSize = 50; // Modify as needed
```


## Usage

To deploy this project run

```bash
async function main() {
    try {
        // Create manager instance
        const manager = new WalletManager("Your_Main_Private_Key", 50);
        
        // Create and manage 10000 wallets with 0.001 ETH each
        const results = await manager.createAndManageWallets(10000, 0.001);
        
        console.log(`Total wallets created: ${results.created}`);
        console.log(`Successful transactions: ${results.successful.length}`);
        console.log(`Failed transactions: ${results.failed.length}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error in wallet management:", error.message);
    }
}

main();
```

Running the Script

```bash
node wallet-manager.js
```

Class Methods
```bash
WalletManager
```

Constructor

```bash
const manager = new WalletManager(mainPrivateKey, batchSize);
```
## Response Format
```bash
javascriptCopy{
    successful: [], // Array of successful wallet addresses
    failed: [     // Array of failed operations
        {
            address: "0x...",
            error: "error message",
            stage: "funding/returning"
        }
    ],
    created: 0    // Total number of wallets created
}
```


# Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling for:

### Insufficient balance

Failed transactions

Network issues

Transaction timeouts

Invalid parameters

### Gas Management

Dynamic gas price fetching

Configurable gas limits

Estimated gas cost calculation

### Monitoring and Logging
The script provides detailed logging of:

Batch processing progress

Transaction success/failure

Error details

Operation statistics

### Best Practices

1. Start with a small batch size (20-50) to test the script
2. Monitor gas prices and adjust accordingly
3. Ensure main wallet has sufficient funds including gas costs
4. Use a reliable Ethereum node/RPC provider
5. Keep private keys secure and never commit them to code

### Security Considerations

1. Never share or expose private keys
2. Test with small amounts first
3. Monitor transactions for unexpected behavior
4. Keep track of created wallets and their states
4. Implement additional security measures for production use

### Limitations

1. Network congestion can affect processing time
2. Gas costs may vary significantly
3. Rate limiting by RPC provider may occur
4. Large batches may require significant funds
